# STM32 UART LED Control

This project demonstrates UART-based LED control using STM32 and Proteus simulation.

## Features:
- STM32F103C6 
- UART command parsing (e.g., "R", "G" and "B")
- Proteus Simulation files included

## Simulation:
Open .pdsprj file in Proteus to run the simulation.

## Tools Used:
- STM32CubeIDE
- Proteus 8
